Optional-import audit
=====================
Usage:
    python scripts/check_optional_imports.py                    # audit this repo
    python scripts/check_optional_imports.py --source DIR --requirements FILE [FILE ...]

Fails when the source imports a third-party module that no dependency file
declares. Exits 0 when clean, 1 when something is undeclared.

Why this exists
---------------
LocalLens shipped `find_duplicates` broken in EVERY build for months. The cause
was one line — `import imagehash` inside the endpoint body — against a package
that appeared in no requirements file. Nothing caught it:

  * PyInstaller/py2app only WARN about unresolved imports, and a deferred import
    inside a function body is not in the startup graph at all, so they saw nothing.
  * The CI smoke test runs `--claude-status`, which walks the *startup* import
    graph. A function-level import does not execute until someone calls that
    function, so the binary starts perfectly.
  * pytest never imported it either — the tests mock the backend.
  * It worked on the maintainer's machine, because the dev venv happened to have
    it. `reportlab` (export_report) is dead in shipped builds for exactly this
    reason right now, and looks fine locally.

So the module was only ever missing for users. This check is the one place that
looks where the packaging tools cannot.

What it deliberately does NOT do
--------------------------------
It does not work out which build job installs which extra. A module declared in
any dependency group passes. The high-signal, zero-false-positive case is a
module declared NOWHERE — that one is provably dead in every artifact, and it is
the case that actually reached customers twice.

It also cannot see a dependency's own optional extras: `send2trash` picks its
Windows backend based on whether `pywin32` imports, and nothing in this repo's
source names pywin32. Transitive optionals need a runtime check, not a static one.
